Free Culture translations of select non-English literature

Rather than clutter my account with multiple tiny repositories, I'm starting to put some time into translating fiction and plan to put the results all here.  Each story will get its own folder with the original (in the public domain) and translated (licensed [CC-BY-SA](./LICENSE.md)) in subfolders named for the language's [ISO 639-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_639-1) code.
