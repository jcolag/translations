## Chapter IV

Ten days later, two small white creoles were playing in the middle of the street.

"Charles," said one of them, "they say that this mulatto who wanted to kill her master will be hanged tomorrow?"

"At eight o'clock," replied the other.

"Will you go?"

"Without a doubt."

"It will be nice to see her pirouette between heaven and earth," resumed the first, and they walked away laughing.

It surprises you to hear two ten-year-olds talking so cheerfully about the deaths of others; it may be a fatal consequence of their education.  From an early age, we repeat to them that we were born to serve them, created for their whims, and that they should consider us no more and no less than a dog.  For what do they care about our agony, and our suffering?  Don't they often see their best horses die?  They don’t cry for the slaves, because they’re rich; tomorrow they’ll buy more.  While these two children were talking, Georges was at his master’s lap.

"Master, please...*please*, he cried, crying, "have mercy on her...master, save her.  Oh!  Yes, save her, because you can.  Oh!  Speak, you only have one word to say...one, and she will live."  Alfred did not answer.

"Oh!  Please, master...please tell me you forgive her.  Oh!  Speak, answer me, master.  Don't you forgive her?"  And the unhappy man writhed in pain.

Alfred, still impassive, turned his head away...

"Oh!" replied Georges, pleading, "answer me...one word.  But answer then.  You do not see that your silence tortures my heart...kills me..."

"There is nothing I can do about it," replied Alfred, in a cold tone.

The mulatto wiped his tears, and rose to his full height.

"Master," he continued in a hollow voice, "do you remember what you said to me, when I twisted on my bed in agony."

"No..."

"Well, I remember!  The master said to the slave:  'You saved my life, what do you want as a reward?  Do you want your freedom...?'  'Master,' replied the slave, 'I cannot be free when my son and my wife are slaves.'  Then the master went on:  'If you ever ask me, I swear that your wishes will be granted;' and the slave did not pray, because he was happy to have saved his master's life.  But today, when he knows that in eighteen hours his wife will no longer live, he runs to throw himself at your feet, and yell at you:  Master, in the name of God, save my wife!"  And the mulatto, his hands clasped, his eyes pleading, returned to his knees and wept streams of tears...

Alfred turned his head away...

"Master...master, please answer me.  Oh!  Say you want her to live.  In the name of God, your mother, grace, mercy," and the mulatto kissed the dust on his master's feet.

Alfred remained silent.

"But at least speak to this poor man who is begging you," he continued, sobbing.

Alfred said nothing.

"My God, my God!  I feel so terrible," and he was rolling on the floor, tearing his hair out in despair.

Finally Alfred decided to speak:  "I already told you that it was no longer mine to forgive."

"Master," murmured Georges, still crying, "she will probably be condemned, because you and I alone know that she is innocent."  At this last word from the mulatto, red rose to Alfred's face and anger in his heart...

Georges understood that it was no longer time to pray, because he had lifted the veil that hid his master's crime.  But he got up with a resolute air.

"Get out...go," cried Alfred.

Instead of going out the mulatto crossed his arms over his chest, and with a fierce look, he looked at his master from head to foot.

"Go away...go away, I tell you," said Alfred, whose anger was growing.

"I will not go out," replied Georges:

"You brave me, wretch?"  He made a movement to strike him, but his hand remained glued to his thigh, there was so much pride and hatred in George's gaze.

"What!  You can let her be killed, slaughtered, murdered," said the mulatto, "when you know she is innocent...when you so cowardly wanted to seduce her."

"Insolent, what do you say?"

"I say it would be an infamy to let her die..."

"Georges...Georges..."

"I say that you are a scoundrel," shouted Georges, giving way to his anger, and grabbing Alfred by the arm.  "Ah!  She will die; she will die because she was not a prostitute to you...to you because you are white...to you because you are her master...infamous bribe..."

"Georges, beware," replied Alfred, trying to assume a confident tone.  "Beware that instead of a single victim tomorrow the executioner can easily find two."

"You speak of victim and executioner, miserably," shouted Georges.  "That means that she will die...she, my Zélie, but you do not know that your life is attached to hers."

"Georges!"

"But you don't know that your head will only hold on your shoulders as long as she lives."

"Georges...Georges!"

"But you don't know that I will kill you...that I will drink your blood if we ever tear a hair from his head."  And all the while the mulatto was shaking Alfred with all the strength of his arm.

"Let go of me," cried Alfred.

"Ah! she will die...she will die," howled the mulatto in delirium.

"Georges, let go of me!"

"Shut up...shut up, wretch!  Ah!  She will die.  Well, that the executioner should strike at the days of my wife," he continued with a frightful smile.

Alfred was so disturbed that he did not see Georges leave. The latter went immediately to his cabin, where, in a light cradle in liana slept a young child of two years, he took him and disappeared.  To understand what will follow, know that from Alfred’s home there was only a small river to cross to find yourself in the middle of those thick forests that seem to embrace all the New World.

Georges had been walking tirelessly for six hours.  Finally he stopped a few steps from a hut, built in the thickest part of the forest.  You will understand this kind of joy that shines in his eyes when you know that this tiny cabin, quite isolated as it is, is in the camp of the brown negroes, that is to say slaves who flee the tyranny of their masters.  At that moment the whole cabin was in rumor.  They had just heard the forest start, and the chief had sworn that this noise was not caused by any animal, and so he cocked his rifle and went out.  Suddenly, the brushwood bow before him, he found himself face to face with a stranger.

"By my freedom," he cried, adjusting the to the darkness, "you knew our niche too well."

"Africa and freedom," replied George without being moved, but pushing aside the barrel of the rifle.  "I'm yours."

"Your name."

"Georges, Alfred's slave."

They reached out and kissed.

The next day, the crowd crowded around a gallows, on which hung the body of a young mulatto.  When she was dead, the executioner lowered her corpse into a fir coffin and ten minutes later they threw bodies and coffin in a pit dug at the entrance of the forest.

So this woman, for having been too virtuous, died from the torture of the infamous.  Do you believe that this fact alone is not enough to make a man the sweetest, meanest, and most bloodthirsty?
