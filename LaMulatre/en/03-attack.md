## Chapter III

Georges had all the necessary disposition to become a very honest man.  But he also had one of those haughty and tenacious wills, one of those exotic personalities that, pushed far enough from the path of virtue, would walk without fear down the road to crime.  He would have given ten years of his life to know the name of his father, but he dared not violate the solemn promise made to his dying mother.  As if nature pushed him towards Alfred, he loved him as much as one could love a man:  While the latter esteemed him, it was with the sort of esteem that a squire carries to the most beautiful and vigorous of his steeds.  At that time, a horde of brigands carried desolation in these places; already more than one settler had been their victim.  One night, I do not know by any chance, Georges was informed of their project.  They had sworn to assassinate Alfred.  Immediately the slave ran to his master.

"Master, master," he cried.  "In the name of heaven, follow me!"

Alfred frowned.

"Oh!  Come, come, master," continued the mulatto with interest.

"Heaven," replied Alfred.  "I believe that you command me."

"Sorry, master...sorry.  I'm so confused.  I don't know what I'm saying, but in the name of heaven, come, follow me, because..."

"Will you explain yourself," said Alfred, in an angry tone.

The mulatto hesitated.

"I want it; I *order* it," said Alfred, standing up threateningly.

"Master, you are to be assassinated tonight."

"Holy Virgin, you lie..."

"Master, they want your life."

"Who?"

"The bandits."

"Who told you?"

"Master, that's my secret," said the mulatto in a submissive voice.

"Are you armed," said Alfred, after a moment of silence?

The mulatto pushed back a few rags which covered him, and revealed an ax and a pair of pistols.

"That's good," said Alfred, arming himself hastily.

"Master, are you ready?"

"Let's go..."

"Let's go," repeated the mulatto, taking a step towards the door.

Alfred held him by the arm.

"But where are we going?"

"To the nearest of your friends, Mr. Arthur."

They were about to leave when the door cried out on its hinges.

"Hell," murmured the mulatto, "it's too late..."

"What are you saying?"

"They are there," replied Georges, pointing to the door.

"Ah!"

"Master, what's the matter?"

"Nothing...just some uneasiness..."

"Don't be afraid, master.  Before I get to you, they'll step on my body," said the slave, calmly and resignedly.

This calm air, this noble devotion were capable of reassuring the most cowardly mortal.  At these last words, however, Alfred trembled more, because a horrible idea overwhelmed him:  He imagined that the generous Georges was the *accomplice* of his murderers.  Such are tyrants; they believe the rest of the men incapable of a high feeling, of boundless devotion, because their souls are narrow and treacherous.  It is an uncultivated land, where grow only the bramble and ivy. The door trembled violently.  This time Alfred could not control his cowardice.  He had just seen the mulatto smile; was it joy or anger?  He did not ask himself this question.

"Wretch!" he cried, rushing into an adjoining room.  "You wanted to have me murdered, but your expectation will be deceived," and he disappeared.  Georges bit his lips in rage, but he couldn't think about it, for the door suddenly opened, and four men stood on the threshold.  As quick as lightning, the mulatto cocked his pistols, and leaned against the wall, crying out in a stentorian voice:

"Demons!  What do you want?"

"We want to speak to you face-to-face," one of them replied, shooting Georges at point-blank range.

"Well shot," he murmured convulsively.

The bullet had smashed his left arm.  He let go.  The brigand turned on himself three times and fell dead.  A second followed him closely.  Then, like a furious lion harassed by hunters, Georges, the ax in his fist and the dagger between his teeth, rushed on his adversaries.  An awful fight began!  The fighters hurried... collided...intertwined.  The ax shone.  Blood flowed.  The dagger, ever faithful to the hand that pushes it, plowed the enemy's chest.  But not a cry, not a word, not a breath escaped from these three mouths of men who rushed between corpses as within an intoxicating orgy.  To see them thus, pale and bloody, dumb and desperate, we see three ghosts who collide and tear at the bottom of a tomb.  However, Georges was covered with wounds and could barely support himself.  Oh, That’s the fearless mulatto!  The sharp ax rose opposite his head.  Suddenly, two more explosions were heard, and the two brigands fell while blaspheming God.  At the same time, Alfred returned, followed by a young negro.  He helped move the wounded man to his cabin, and gave orders to bring his doctor; George was saved by the very man who accused him of treason.  Barely away, Alfred heard the sound of a gun, the clatter of the iron; blushing at his cowardice, he awakened his valet, and flew to the rescue of his liberator.

I forgot to tell you that Georges had a wife named Zélie, whom he loved with all the power of his soul; she was a mulatto of eighteen to twenty years of age, with an arched waist, black hair, and a look full of love and voluptuousness.  Georges remained twelve days between life and death.  Alfred went to see him often.  Driven by I do not know what fate, he fell in love with Zélie, but unfortunately for him, he was not one of those women who sell their love, or who pay homage to their master.  She rejected Alfred's proposals with humble dignity, because she didn’t forget that it was the master speaking to his slave.

Instead of being touched by this virtue so rare among women, especially among those who, like Zélie, are slaves, and who see their immodest companions every day prostitute themselves to the colonists, and feed their libertinage; instead of being touched, I said, Alfred got irritated.  What, *him*, the despot, the bey, the sultan of the Antilles, to be looked down upon by a slave?  What irony!  So he swore to take her.  A few days before Georges's convalescence, Alfred asked Zelie to be asked into his room.  So, listening only to his criminal desires, he embraced her, and placed a burning kiss on her cheek.  The young slave prayed, begged, resisted, but in vain.  He was all but dragging her towards the adulterous layer already.  Then, the virtuous slave, full of noble indignation, repulsed him with a last effort, but so abrupt, but so powerful, that Alfred lost his balance and smashed his head as he fell.  At this sight, Zélie tore her hair out in despair, and wept in rage, because she had understood---the unhappy one---that death awaited her for having shed the blood of such a vile being.  When she had cried well, she went to her husband.  He probably dreamed of her, because he had a smile on his lips.

"Georges...Georges," she cried anxiously.

The mulatto opened his eyes.  The first need he felt was to smile at his beloved.  Zélie told him what just happened.  He would not believe it, but soon he was convinced of his misfortune, for men entered his cabin and tied up his crying wife.  Georges made an effort to get up, but still too weak, he fell back on the couch, haggard eyes, clenched hands, gasping mouth.
