## Chapter II

Alfred was perhaps good---human, loyal to his equals---but surely he was a tough, mean man towards his slaves.  I will not tell you everything he did to possess La√Øsa; because it sometimes approached rape.  For almost a year, she shared her master's world, but already Alfred was getting tired of her; he found her ugly, cold, and insolent.  About this time, the poor woman gave birth to a son whom she named Georges.  Alfred misunderstood the situation, chased the mother out of his presence, and had her relegated to the worst shack in his house, despite being convinced, as far as anybody could be be, that he was the father of this child.

So, Georges had grown up without ever hearing his father's name named, and if he sometimes tried to unravel the mystery that surrounded his birth, he found his mother inflexible and dumb to his questions.  Only once, she said to him:

My son, you will not know his name until your twenty-fifth year.  For then, you will be a man; you'll be more able to keep such a secret.  So you don't know that he forbade me to talk to you about him, on pain of hating you.  And you see, Georges, the hatred of this man is death.

"What does it matter," exclaimed Georges impetuously.  "I could at least blame him for his infamous conduct..."

"Shut up...shut up, Georges!  The walls have ears, and the brush can speak," murmured the poor mother, trembling.

A few years later, this unhappy woman was dying, leaving for Georges---her only son---a small bag in deerskin, in which was located the portrait of her father, but only on the promise of his not opening it until its twenty-fifth year.  Then, she kissed him, and her head fell on the pillow; she was dead.  The cry of pain that the orphan threw attracted the other slaves.  They began to cry, to strike their breasts, to pluck their hair out of despair.  After these first marks of pain, they washed the body of the deceased, and exposed it on a kind of long table, and supported by the trestles.  The dead woman lay on her back, her face turned to the East, dressed in her best clothes, and her hands crossed over her chest.  At his feet, a small cup full of holy water, on which floats a branch of jasmine.  Finally, at the four corners of the mortuary layer, torches rose.  Everyone, after blessing the remains of the deceased, knelt and prayed, because most of the Negro races, despite their fetishism, deeply believe in existence of God.  This first ceremony finished, another no less singular began.  There are cries, tears, songs.  Then...funeral dances!
