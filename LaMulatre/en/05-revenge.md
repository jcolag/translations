## Chapter V

Three years had passed since the death of the virtuous Zélie.  Alfred at first was very tormented.  By day, he thought he saw a vengeful hand lowering on his forehead at all hours.  He trembled at night, because it brought him dreadful and terrible dreams.  But soon, driving out of his soul both the painful memory of martyrdom and the terrible threat of George, he married, became a father.  Oh, he was happy when they came to tell him that his wishes were granted, he who humbly kissed the pavement of the temple each evening, praying to the Madonna in pain to grant him a son.

Georges also had his share of happiness at the birth of this child, because if he had hoped for three years without knowing how to hit the executioner of his wife---if he had spent so many sleepless nights, fury in his heart, and his hand on his dagger---it was that he was waiting for Alfred to have, like him, a wife and a son, is that he only wanted to kill him when dear and precious links kept him in this world.  Georges had always had intimate relations with one of Alfred's slaves; he even went to see them all the weeks.  Now this slave had nothing more anxious than to announce to him the existence of the newborn!  Immediately, Georges flew towards the house of his enemy, met on his way a negress who was carrying a cup of bouillon to Madame Alfred.  He stopped her.  She said a few insignificant words to him and walked away.  After many difficulties, he managed to slip like a snake into Alfred's bedroom.  There, hidden behind the alley of the bed, he waited for his former master.  Alfred returned a moment later, singing.  He opened his secretary desk and took from it a superb diamond case which he had promised to his wife, if the latter gave him a son.  Full of joy and happiness, he sat with his head in both hands, like a man who cannot believe in unexpected happiness.  But when he looked up, he saw before him a sort of motionless shadow, its arms crossed over its chest, and two fiery eyes which had all the ferocity of the tiger about to tear its prey.  Alfred made a movement to get up, but a powerful hand held him back on the chair.

"What do you want with me?"  Alfred stressed in a trembling voice.

"Compliment you on the birth of your son," replied a voice that seemed to come out of the grave.  Alfred shivered from head to foot, his hair stood on end, and a cold sweat flooded his limbs.

"I don't know you," murmured Alfred weakly...

"My name is Georges."

"You..."

"You thought I was dead, didn't you," said the mulatto with a convulsive laugh.

"Help!  Help," cried Alfred...

"Who will help you," resumed the mulatto.  "Have you not sent away your servants, closed all your doors, to be more alone with your wife?  So you see that your cries are useless.  Recommend your soul to God."

Alfred slowly rose from his chair, but at that last word he fell back pale and trembling.

"Oh!  Please, Georges, don't kill me, today."

Georges shrugged.  "Master, is it not horrible to die when one is happy, to lie in the grave when you see your dearest dreams come true.  Oh, isn’t that awful," said the mulatto with a hellish laugh.

"Grace, Georges..."

"However," he continued, "such is your destiny.  You will die today, at this hour, in a minute, without saying your last goodbye to your wife..."

"Please...please..."

"Without kissing your newly born son a second time..."

"Oh!  Thanks...thanks."

"I believe my revenge worthy of yours.  I would have sold my soul to Satan, if he had promised me this moment."

"Oh!  Mercy," said Alfred, throwing himself at the knees of the mulatto.

Georges shrugged, and raised his ax.

"Oh!  Another hour of life!"

"To kiss your wife isn’t it?"

"One minute..."

"To see your son again, right?"

"Oh!  Pity..."

"It would be better to ask the hungry tiger to let go of its prey."

"In the name of God, George."

"I do not believe it anymore."

"In the name of your father..."  At this word George's anger subsided.

"My father...my *father*," said the mulatto with tears in his eye, "you know him...oh!  Tell me his name.  What's his name?  Oh!  Say, tell me his name.  I will bless you.  I will forgive you."

And the mulatto was ready to kneel before his master. But suddenly sharp cries could be heard...

"Heaven, that’s my wife’s voice," cried Alfred, rushing to where the screams were coming from...

As if reminded of himself, the mulatto remembered that he had come to his master, not to know his father's name, but to ask him to take account of his wife's blood. Holding Alfred immediately, he said to him with a horrible sneer:  "Stop it, master, it's nothing."

"Jesus Maria, you don’t hear that she is asking for help."

"It's nothing, I tell you."

"Let go of me.  Let go of me!  That's my wife's voice."

"No, it's the groan of a dying woman."

"Miserable, you're lying."

"I poisoned her."

"Oh!"

"Do you hear these complaints?  These are his."

"Hell..."

"Do you hear these cries?  These are his..."

"Curse..."

And all the while, Alfred was trying to escape from the mulatto's hands.  But he was hugging him more and more, for he too was exalted, his heart leapt.  He got used to his terrible role.

"Alfred!  Help!  Water!  I'm choking," cried a woman, rushing into the middle of the room.  She was pale and defeated, her eyes popped out of her head, her hair was messy.

"Alfred, Alfred, in the name of heaven, help me!  A little water...a little water.  My blood is burning, my heart is tense, oh!  Water, water..."

Alfred made incredible efforts to rescue her, but Georges was holding him with his iron wrist, and---sneering like a damned man---he cried out to him:  "No, master, no.  I want this woman to die.  There, in your eyes, in front of you.  Do you understand, master?  In front of you, begging you for water, air, without you being able to help her?"

"O woe, woe to you," Alfred howled, struggling like a madman.

"No matter how much you curse, blaspheme," replied the mulatto, "it must be so."

Alfred, murmured the dying woman again, "farewell, farewell, I'm dying..."

"Look," resumed the mulatto still sneering.  "Look, she groans...well!  A single drop of this water would bring her back to life."  He showed her a small bottle.

"All my fortune for this drop of water," cried Alfred.

"Are you crazy, master..."

"Ah!  This water, this water, don't you see that she is dying?  Give...give..."

"Here," and the mulatto broke the bottle against the wall.

"Cursed," yelled Alfred, grabbing Georges by the neck.  "Oh!  My whole life, my *soul* for a dagger..."

Georges got rid of Alfred’s hands.

"Now, it is your turn, master," he said, lifting his ax.

"Strike, executioner, strike.  After having poisoned her, you may well kill your father!"

The ax fell and Alfred's head rolled on the floor, but the head while rolling distinctly murmured the last syllable *errr*...

Georges thought he had heard wrong, but the word *father*, like a death knell, tinkled in his ear.  To make sure, he opened the bag that would end his questions.  "Ah," he cried, "I am cursed!"  An explosion was heard.  The next day, the body of the unfortunate Georges was found near Alfred's body.
